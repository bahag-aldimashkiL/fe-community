# Discussion of the month

Once in a month we will get togther and discuss something important in our working life at BAUHASE, it maybe somthing new or somthing intersting to our community members. Feel free to add the topics you would like to share the community with. \
It may take an hour max and 2 mintues min :wink: , the imporatnt part here is to share knowledge and rise up the community members skills.
