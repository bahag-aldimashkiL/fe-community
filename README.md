## WELCOME TO THE BFE COMMUNITY!
It's never easy arriving in a new location, so we are here to help you get caught up and feeling like home.
Once inside the BFE Community checkout [#welcome](welcome.md) for a walkthrough of our community rules, and how to get the best help possible from our community. Most of the time the first thing a member does is to introduce themselves in the [#introduction](introduction.md) page.


## WHAT NEXT!?
After you read our rules and code of conduct in the [#welcome](welcome.md) page and introduce us yourself in [#introduction](introduction.md), it is time now to check our other nice rooms and channels in our community.
