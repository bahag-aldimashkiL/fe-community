## Get Support!

### 4 STEPS TO GET BETTER SUPPORT!
In a fast moving support enviornment such as our Teams channels, asking your question in an effective manner is even more paramount. Lets take a look at some ways to help your helpers help you!


:one:â€‚â€‚SEARCH & RESEARCH\
Before asking for help no matter where it is, there are several things you will be expected to have done yourself. No one wants to do all the work for you, you should have atleast tried to solve your own problem by:
<ul>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Google & Stackoverflow</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Documentation</li>
</ul>


:two:â€‚â€‚BE RELEVANT\
Do not paste all of your code, instead identify which part of the code has the problem. Pasting only the relevant portion of your code will significantly increase your chance of solving your issue for multiple reasons:
<ul>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Helpers aren't overwhelmed by a hard to read wall of code.</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Helpers love to help those that show they are trying to help them selves.</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: The answer may become more obvious to more people.</li>
</ul>

If your issue is very complicated and consists of many modules, provide the link to your repository instead. Not enough information is just as bad as too much.

You may go on one 2 one session with one of the colleagues if he/she offers and try solving/debugging together.


:three:â€‚â€‚FORMAT YOUR CODE\
Take the time to format your code, so that helpers are able to easily and quickly read your code. Its likely that people with not take the time to read messy code. You can use a code formatting extension such as `Prettier`


:four:â€‚â€‚SCREENSHOTS\
Ideally code should be sent in the form of code blocks or repo links, it makes it easy for the helper to test out possible solutions without the need to rewrite everything from scratch. If you must send a screenshoot here are some ideals that you should follow:
<ul>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Do not take a photo of your code using a phone!</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Instead use the Window Snipping Tool</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Ensure the image is clear and readable. If you struggle helpers will to!</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Post multiple screenshots rather than making it all fit into one screenshot.</li>
 <li style="list-style-type: none">:small_orange_diamond: Remove irrelevant sections from the shot, such as the terminal or file nav panel.</li>
